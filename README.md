## Conway's Game of Life Rules
* If a cell is alive, and 2 or 3 of it's neighbours are also alive, the cell remains alive.
* If a cell is alive and it has more than 3 alive neighbours, it dies.
* If a cell is alive and it has fewer than 2 alive neighbours, it dies.
* If a cell is dead and it has exactly 3 neighbours it becomes alive again.
